# vaccine-system
vaccine tracking system with data structure and c++
I have three classes in that project( vaccine - request - users)
there are 3 types of users admin worker and regular user 
the regular user can sign in and sign out and see his vaccination status and update and view and delete his data
worker can Add the User to a wiating list and Store User's vaccination status (1.Pending, 2.Fulfilled, 3.Missed) and Load Patients to be vaccinated today 
admin can view all users data and also delete one or all users
